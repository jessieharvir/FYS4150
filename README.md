# FYS4150 - Computational Physics
An introduction to numerical methods which are used in solving problems in physics and chemistry, including solutions of differential equations, matrix operations and eigenvalue problems, interpolation and numerical integration, modeling of data and Monte Carlo methods.
## Project 1
Solution to the Poission equation in special one-dimensional form. A tridiagonal matrix algorithm is implemented and compared in effeciency to the more general LU decomposition method.
## Project 2
Solution to the Schr√∂dinger's equation for two electrons in a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential well with and without repulsive Coulomb interaction.
## Project 3
Numerical integration with Gaussian Quadrature and Monte Carlo methods. Here We have used Gauss-Laguerre and Gauss-Legendre polynimials to solve a six-dimentional integral, which is used to solve the ground state correlation energy between two electrons in a Helium atom. To speed up things, the Monte Carlo method was implemented, and later also the use of MPI.
